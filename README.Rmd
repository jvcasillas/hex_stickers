## hex-stickers

A repo for my hex stickers. You can find all the [code used to create the hex logos](./scripts) as well as the [PNGs](./stickers). This repo was forked from 
[mkearney/hex-stickers](https://github.com/mkearney/hex-stickers), but has 
changed a lot. 

```{r, results = 'asis', echo=F}
list.files("./stickers") %>% 
  as_tibble(.) %>% 
  rename(., val = value) %>% 
  filter(., val != "rap-group-v2.png") %>% 
  pull(.) %>% 
  sprintf("<p align='center'><img src='stickers/%s' width='200px'/></p>", .) %>%
  paste(collapse = "\n\n") %>% 
  cat(fill = TRUE)
```
